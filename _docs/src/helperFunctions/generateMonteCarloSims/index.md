  Generate Monte-Carlo simulations for (controlled/uncontrolled) LTI/LTV system 
  =============================================================================
  
  generateMonteCarloSims produces a required number of trajectories,
  n_monte_carlo_sims, for a (affine-controlled/uncontrolled) LTI/LTV system sys
  with a deterministic/RandomVector initial_state for a given time_horizon. 
 
  If the system is controlled, then a causal disturbance-feedback affine
  controller may be specified (dist_feedback_gain, concat_input_vector). The
  controller will be saturated to the sys.input_space using projection. 
 
  For an open-loop controller, only an concat_input_vector may be specified and
  dist_feedback_gain is set to zero.

    time_horizon        - Time horizon (N) of the stochastic reach-avoid problem
    concat_input_vector - [Optional] Open-loop controller, a column vector of
                          dimension (sys.input_dim*N) x 1 | Required only if 
                          the system is controlled

                          disturbance feedback, and the gain matrix must be
                          lower block triangular (with zeros in its block
                          diagonal elements) for causality | See Notes
    srlcontrol          - [Optional but no concat_input_vector and empty

                          describing an admissible state feedback controller
                          corresponding to the Lagrangian-based

  Notes:
  ------
  * Assumes IID disturbance for the LTI/LTV system. 
  * For controlled system, an open-loop controller NEEDS to be provided. The
    optimal_input_vector should be a ((sys.input_dim) * time_horizon)-dim.
    vector U = [u_0; u_1; ...; u_N] (column vector).
  * For uncontrolled system, the optimal_input_vector NEED NOT be provided
    dist_feedback_gain must be lower
  * The disturbance feedback gain matrix must be lower block triangular, with
    its block diagonal submatrices as zero matrices. This ensures that the
    affine disturbance feedback controller's value at any point of time depends
    only on the past disturbance values => causal controller. This function DOES
    NOT check for this structure in the input gain.
  * Affine disturbance feedback controllers CAN NOT satisfy hard control bounds
    when the disturbance is unbounded (like Gaussian). Therefore, we will
    saturate the controller realization (associated with the disturbance
    realization) via projection on to the concatenated input space.
    Specifically, we solve the corresponding optimization problem for each
    concatenated disturbance realization W
    
        minimize || U - (MW + D)||_2
        subject to 
            U \in \mathcal{U}^T
 
    where U is the decision variable, \mathcal{U} is the input space, T is the
    time horizon, M is the affine disturbance feedback gain, and D is the affine
    disturbance feedback bias.
  * When using SReachLagController, verbosity may be specified in the following
    way:
        % Create a controller based on the underapproximation
        srlcontrol = SReachLagController(sys, ... 
            extra_info_under.bounded_dist_set, ...
            extra_info_under.stoch_reach_tube);
        % Generate Monte-Carlo simulations using the srlcontrol and
        % generateMonteCarloSims
        timer_mcarlo = tic;
        [X,U,W] = generateMonteCarloSims(n_mcarlo_sims, sys, ...
            initial_state, time_horizon, srlcontrol, [], ...
            lagunder_options.verbose);
