  Get a scaled version of the user-specified polytope via bisection method
  =============================================================================
  
  This function solves the following optimization problem
 
    minimize    vol( \theta Polytope(A,b))
    subject to  Prob{ w \in \theta Polytope(A,b) } = \gamma
                \gamma > 0
  where w is a RandomVector object, Polytope(A,b) = Polyhedron('H',[A b]) is a 
  polytope given by {x: Ax<=b} that CONTAINS the origin, \gamma is a probability 
  threshold [0,1] that the optimal bounded set (\theta^\ast Polytope(A,b))
  must have the probability of occurence.
 
  The polytope computed is guaranteed to have a probability no smaller than
  the specified threshold. The guarantee is probabilistic (via Hoeffding
  inequality or a confidence interval estimate).
 
  This problem is solved using an equivalent single-variable convex 
  optimization problem in
 
    J. Gleason, A. Vinod, and M. Oishi, "Lagrangian Approximations for
    Stochastic Reachability of a Target Tube," 2018.

  =============================================================================
  
  bounded_set = getBsetWithProb(dist, polytope, prob_threshold,desired_accuracy)
  
  Inputs:
  -------
    dist            - RandomVector object
    polytope        - Polyhedron object whose scaled version is the bounded_set                     
    prob_threshold  - Probability threshold (gamma)
    desired_accuracy- Maximum absolute deviation in the probability estimate
  
  Outputs:
  --------
    bounded_set     - Polyhedron object
 
  Notes:
  ------
  * Prob{ w \in \theta Polytope(A,b) } is computed using
    RandomVector/getProbPolyhedron.
  * Requires the desired_accuracy to be at least 1e-2.
