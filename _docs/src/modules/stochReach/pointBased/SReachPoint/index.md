  Solve the problem of stochastic reachability of a target tube from a given
  initial state using a host of techniques
  =============================================================================
 
  SReachPoint can (approximately) solve the problem of stochastic reachability 
  of a target tube from a given initial state,
 
      maximize Prob( \cap_{i=1}^N x_t lies in Safe_t)
      subject to
            dynamics and bounds on control
 
  This function can compute an underapproximation to the optimal value of the
  above problem as well as synthesize controllers:
  1. open-loop controller that satisfies the prespecified hard control bounds,
  2. affine disturbance feedback controller that satisfies the hard control
        bounds with a likelihood above the user-specified threshold.
  This function is a compilation of various techniques proposed in the
  literature.
 
  The problem of stochastic reachability of a target tube is discussed in 
 
  A. Vinod and M. Oishi, "Stochastic reachability of a target tube: Theory and
  computation," IEEE Transactions in Automatic Control, 2018 (submitted) URL:
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05217.pdf.
 
  It subsumes the terminal hitting-time stochastic reach-avoid problem (Summers
  and Lygeros, Automatica, 2010) as well as the stochastic viability problem
  (Abate et. al, Automatica, 2008).
 
  This function is a compilation of various techniques proposed in the
  literature:
 
  1. Convex chance-constrained-based approach (chance-open):
 
     High-level desc.   : Use Boole's inequality, Gaussian random vector, and
                          piecewise linear approximation of the inverse of the
                          standard normal cumulative density function to create
                          a linear program-based approximation to the original
                          optimization

                          the inverse of the standard normal cumulative density
                          function to create a second-order cone program-based
                          difference-of-convex optimization problem
     Controller type    : A history-dependent affine controller that satisfies
                          softened input constraints (controller satisfies the
                          hard input bounds upto a user-specified probabilistic
                          threshold)

  3. Uniform risk allocation-based approach (chance-affine-uni):
 
     High-level desc.   : Use Boole's inequality, Gaussian random vector,
                          hyperbolic constraints-to-second order cone constraint
                          reformulation. By decoupling the risk allocation
                          from controller synthesis, this approach solves a
                          series of SOCP problems guided by a bisection on
                          the uniform risk allocation (See Notes)

  Notes:
  * SReachPoint() will call SReachPointOptions() internally if
        SReachPointOptions()-based options is not explicitly provided to
        SReachPoint(). This will set the algorithm to default options.
  * 'chance-affine' and 'chance-affine-uni' requires an explicit declaration of 
    the options from SReachPointOptions() to specify the threshold on the 
    chance-constraint relaxation of the input bounds.
  * 'chance-affine' provides the best lower bound at the cost of additional
    compute time, when compared to 'chance-affine-uni'
  * See @LtiSystem/getConcatMats for more information about the notation used.
  * If an open_loop policy is desired arranged in increasing time columnwise,
    use the following command:
        optimal_open_loop_control_policy = reshape(opt_controller, ...
            sys.input_dim, time_horizon);
