  SReachPointOptions creates a MATLAB struct that contains user-specifiable
  options that may be used with SReachPoint

  Outputs:
  --------
    options     - Collection of user-specified options for given method_str
 
  See also SReachPoint.
 
  Notes:
  * SReachPoint() will call this function internally using the default
    values if SReachPointOptions()-based options is not explicitly provided
    to SReachPoint().
  * To specify a desired set of samples V to use when undersampling in 
    voronoi-X, set the undersampling fraction to be very small (say 1e-4/1e-5) 
    and set min_samples to V.
  * For sampling-based approaches, we impose a heuristic maximum allowed
    particles. This bound is used to throw a pre-emptive error for very 
    demanding problem requirements. The user MAY MODIFY it to allow the
    computations beyond the limit.
  * max_input_viol_prob has been left as addParameter instead of
    addRequired, so that default values may be specified.
  * For 'genzps-open', options.thresh permits early termination if instead
    of maximal reach probability is of interest. While this function is for 
    maximal reach probability, this optional feature permits the reuse of
    code in SReachSet.
  * In 'genzps-open', desired accuracy is the farthest lower bound on the
    confidence interval acceptable. In order to remain conservative,
    RandomVector/getProbPolyhedron subtracts desired_accuracy from the result to
    yield an underapproximation. For higher desired_accuracy, the result may be
    more conservative but faster. For lower desired_accuracy, the result may
    take more time.
