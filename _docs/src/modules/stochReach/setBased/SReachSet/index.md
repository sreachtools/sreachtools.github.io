  Compute the stochastic reach set corresponding to the stochastic reachability 
  problem of a target tube using a host of techniques
  =============================================================================
 
  SReachSet computes an approximation to the stochastic reach set of the 
  stochastic reachability problem of a target tube. Specifically, it
  computes an (over- and under-)approximation to the set 
   
     L_0(\alpha) = {x_0 \in X: V_0(x_0) >= \alpha} 
 
  where
 
      V_0(x_0) = maximize Prob( \cap_{i=1}^N x_t lies in Safe_t)
                 subject to
                    dynamics and bounds on control
 
  In other words, V_0 is the maximal reach probability associated with the
  problem of stochastic reachability of a target tube, and L_0(\alpha) is the
  stochastic reach set --- the set of initial states from which an admissible
  controller exists that can drive the state to stay within the safety tube
  {Safe_t}_{t=1}^{N}.
 
  This function is a compilation of various techniques proposed in the
  literature:

    'genzps-open' is to be used. See SReachSetOptions() for more details

      - From computational geometry, intersections and Minkowski differences are
        best performed in facet representation and Minkowski sums are best
        performed in vertex representation. However, since in this computation,
        all three operations are required, scalability of the algorithm is
        severly hampered, despite theoretical elegance.
      - Since box and random approaches in SReachSetOptions produce Polyhedron
        objects for disturbance sets, we rely on MPT for all the set operations.
        This means we do have scalability issues mentioned above.
      - For ellipsoid approach in SReachSetOptions, we seek a purely facet-based
        operation and utilize the ray-shooting algorithm to compute a
        facet-based underapproximation of the Minkowski sum step (via
        vertex-based underapproximation, followed by projection, followed by
        convex hull operation)
      - While 'Gaussian' disturbance can have options.bound_set_method be
        'polytope' or 'ellipsoid', 'UserDefined' disturbance requires
        options.bound_set_method to be 'polytope'.
