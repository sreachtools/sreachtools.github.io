                                          for vertex-facet enumeration.
                b. 'lrs'                - Use GeoCalcLib (a MATLAB bridge to
                                          McGill's LRS C code base) for
                                          vertex-facet enumeration
 
  Outputs:
  --------
    options     - Collection of user-specified options
                  (Matlab struct created using SReachSetOptions)
 
  See also SReachSet.
 
  Notes:
  * Requires set_of_dir_vecs for the methods 'chance-open' and 'genzps-open'.
  * Requires load_str for the method lag-under with bound_set_method 'load'
  * Requires template_polytope for the method lag-under with
    bound_set_method 'polytope'
        - The template polytope must contain the origin
  * compute_style governs the computation style used to implement the Lagrangian
    technique for over and under approximation. 
        - By default, the compute_style is 'vfmethod'. This approach will fast
          in low dimensions, it does not scale well with dimension due to the
          vertex-facet enumeration. It implements the recursion using the native
          operations available via MPT3.
        - Alternatively, the compute_style 'support' uses support function to
          implement the Lagrangian approximations. 
            * Since polytopes are obtained by sampling the support function, we
              require vectors that are equally spaced apart in the required
              Euclidean space.
                - In SReachSetOptions, these vectors are stored in the field
                `equi_dir_vecs`.
                - They are auto-generated by the options difference-of-convex
                  programming.
            * Requires system for the computation of these vectors.
            * For lag-over, this computation style is recursion-free. 
                - Utilizes the support function available as a simple LP
                - Requires equally spaced vectors in R^(sys.state_dim), obtained
                  via difference-of-convex programming.
                - Computes an affine transformation of these vectors for
                  meaningful overapproximation. A maximum volume ellipsoid
                  approximately inscribed within the polytope is computed using
                  scenario-based robust convex programming.
                - Returns a tight overapproximation of the overapproximation
                  polytope by sampling this support function.
            * For lag-under, this computation style is `vfmethod guided by
              support functions` to reduce some of the computational overhead
              associated with `vfmethod`.
                - The polytopes are always expressed in the half-space form with
                  the Minowksi sum computed by projecting the higher dimensional
                  polytope constructed in state_space x input_space into the
                  state_space. 
                - The half-space form of the high dimension polytope is sampled
                  to obtain the vertex form of an underapproximate polytope,
                  which after projection, is converted back into its half-space
                  form.
  * While specifying n_vertices, use the formula 
    2^{n_dim} points_per_quad + 2 * n_dim 
    to obtain a spread of points where each quadrant has `points_per_quad`
    and the standard axis are also included.
        - For lag-under, n_dim is sys.state_dim + sys.input_dim
        - For lag-over, n_dim is sys.state_dim
  * Vertex-facet enumeration is a computationally hard problem. SReachTools
    currently support two popular techniques for addressing the same:
    1. CDDMEX - MPT's preferred approach for vertex-facet enumeration
                * Requires no additional installation steps
                * Known to provide incorrect results or fail completely in some
                  cases
                * See following websites for more information: 
                    https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/fukudak/cdd_home/index.html
                    http://www.swmath.org/software/5097
    2. LRS    - Avis's LRS with MATLAB interface provided Rainer's GeoCalcLib
                * Requires few additional installation steps
                * Worked more reliably than CDDMEX
                * See following websites for more information: 
                    http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html
                    http://worc4021.github.io/GeoCalcLib/
  * While 'Gaussian' disturbance can have options.bound_set_method be 'polytope'
    or 'ellipsoid', 'UserDefined' disturbance requires options.bound_set_method
    to be 'polytope'.
  * In 'genzps-open', desired accuracy is the farthest lower bound on the
    confidence interval acceptable. In order to remain conservative,
    RandomVector/getProbPolyhedron subtracts desired_accuracy from the result to
    yield an underapproximation. For higher desired_accuracy, the result may be
    more conservative but faster. For lower desired_accuracy, the result may
    take more time.
