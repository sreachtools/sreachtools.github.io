We have released the first public version of the SReachTools (Stochastic Reachability Tools) Toolbox! The codes and functionality of [v0.1](https://github.com/sreachtools/SReachTools/tree/v0.1-alpha) have been tested internally by us, but we do expect bugs to be present. 

Please help us out: if you use the code and find a bug, create an [issue](https://github.com/sreachtools/SReachTools/issues) so we know what needs to be fixed. If you would like to fix the bug yourself, please check out our [contributing](/contributing) page.

We will continue to make changes to the code over the next month in preparation for the v1 release (expected in late July/early August).
