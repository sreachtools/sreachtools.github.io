     uses a randomized quasi-random rule with m points to estimate an
     MVN probability for positive semi-definite covariance matrix r,
     with constraints a &lt; cn*x &lt; b. If r is nxn and cn is kxn, then

      a = [ -inf 1 -5 ]'; b = [ 3 inf 4 ]';

   This function uses an algorithm given in the paper by Alan Genz:
    "Numerical Computation of Multivariate Normal Probabilities", in
      J. of Computational and Graphical Stat., 1(1992), 141-149.
   The primary references for the numerical integration are

    "Randomization of Number Theoretic Methods for Multiple Integration"
