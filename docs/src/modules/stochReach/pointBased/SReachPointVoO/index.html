  Inputs:
  -------
    sys          - System description (LtvSystem/LtiSystem object)
    initial_state- Initial state for which the maximal reach probability must be
                   evaluated (A numeric vector of dimension sys.state_dim)
    safety_tube  - Collection of (potentially time-varying) safe sets that

    options      - Collection of user-specified options for 'voronoi-open'

    opt_input_vec
                - Open-loop controller: column vector of dimension

  Notes:
  * This function requires CVX with Gurobi as the backend solver for optimizing
    the resulting mixed-integer linear program.
  * This function requires kmeans function which is part of MATLAB's
    Statistical and Machine Learning toolbox.
  * See @LtiSystem/getConcatMats for more information about the notation used.
  * This function computes an approximate stochastic reach probability with a
    probabilistic guarantee of being an underapproximation. Specifically, it
    computes an underapproximation of the maximal reach probability with the
    probabilistic guarantee that the risk of failure of this underapproximation
    is no larger than the user-specified failure_risk. 
  * The number of scenarios required to guarantee the above statement is:
        - directly proportional to the -log(failure_risk). 
        - inversely proportional to the square of maximum overapproximation
          error.
    The maximum overapproximation error is the correction term, the threshold
    that is removed from the optimal solution of the MILP to guarantee the
    underapproximation.
  * Ideally, we should solve the MILP with the number of scenarios prescribed by
    the above note. However, this number is typically high rendering the MILP
    intractable.
  * Therefore, we solve an undersampled MILP, where the user specifies the
    number of representative scenarios to consider (n_kmeans). Larger n_kmeans
    implies higher accuracy for the approx_stoch_reach. However, this comes at
    the computational cost of solving the MILP, which has n_kmeans binary
    variables.
