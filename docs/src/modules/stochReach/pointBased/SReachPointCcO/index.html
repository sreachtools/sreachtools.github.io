  SReachPointCcO implements a chance-constrained convex underapproximation to

  spacecraft relative motion," in IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),
  2013.
 
  This function implements a convex solver-friendly using piecewise-affine
  overapproximations of the convex constraints, as discussed in
 
  A. Vinod and M. Oishi. Affine controller synthesis for stochastic reachability
  via difference of convex programming. In Proc. Conf. Dec. &amp; Ctrl., 2019.
