  Forward stochastic reachability analysis quantifies the stochasticity of the
  state at a future time instant, as well as the probability of the state lying
  in a pre-specified set at a future time instant. This function implements
  ideas from

  In this case, the approach coincides with Kalman filter updates, and it 
  is grid-free, recursion-free, and sampling-free. 
 
  SReachFwd also exploits the functionality of random vector to provide

  Notes:
  ------
  * Assumes IID disturbance.
  * The outputs are either (mean_vec, cov_mat) or (prob), depending on the
    method_str
  * For concat-prob, target_time can be any value between 0 and N where
    target_tube has a length of N+1 (N+1 target sets to include the

  * For XXX-prob, the random vector is provided as the second output.
  * Prob{ w \in \theta Polytope(A,b) } is computed using
    RandomVector/getProbPolyhedron.
  * Requires the desired_accuracy to be at least 1e-2.
