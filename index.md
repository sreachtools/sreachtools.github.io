## What does SReachTools do? 

Given a discrete-time linear system with an additive stochastic disturbance,
SReachTools constructs a set of safe initial states that satisfy some
reachability/safety specification with at least a desired likelihood
(*verification*). It can also *synthesize* controllers for these specifications
under soft/hard control bounds.

    <b>SReachTools can design controllers that maximize the probability of
    staying within the target tube, and characterize the set of initial states
    \(\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{SR}(\cdot)\) that satisfy a minimum reach
    probability. Image licensed under a <a rel="license"

SReachTools exploits convex optimization, Fourier transforms, and computational
geometry to obtain *scalable* results, without relying on *any* abstractions.
